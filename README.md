# recognition-mnist-database

The objective of this project is:
1. Create a frontend which should run on a web browser and should support the upload of a character containing a single digit.
The digits can be the ones belonging to the MNIST dataset, available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. Create a REST API that receives the request and returns which digit was sent.

3. Show the result of the request on the frontend.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I used and trained a Microsoft API (Custo Vision AI) to the recognit the digit. In the future probably I will use the TensorFlow to recognition, to develop my skills with machine learning concepts.

The result in the frontend is being shown with "console.log ()".
